# Uber Data Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze Uber ride data in New York City using Python programming language and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset used for analysis is obtained from a CSV file named "uber.csv".

## Overview
The analysis includes the following steps:
1. Loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Checking the data types and converting the "Date/Time" column to datetime format.
3. Adding additional columns for day, weekday, and hour extracted from the "Date/Time" column.
4. Visualizing the density of Uber rides per day, hour, and weekday using Seaborn's distplot.

## Insights
Based on the analysis, the following insights were derived:
- Uber tends to generate the most revenue on Mondays.
- Saturdays witness comparatively fewer Uber rides.
- The busiest hour for Uber rides on weekdays is 6 p.m.
- Uber trip numbers show an increase around 5 a.m.
- The majority of Uber trips originate from the New York area, particularly around Manhattan.

## Usage
To replicate or further explore the analysis:
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
3. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the analysis.

## Files
- `uber.csv`: The dataset containing Uber ride data, sourced from Kaggle.
